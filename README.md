CIFAR10- Object Recognition


The repository contains implementation and evaluation of several Models for CIFAR10 character recognition

Below are some Feature Extraction and Modules implemented.

    1. Feature Extraction: 
            --> Standarized Image
            --> Edge Features.
            --> Histogram of Gradients
            --> ZCA whitened
    
    2. Models:
            --> K-nearest Neighbors
            --> Logistic Regression
            --> Support Vector Machines
            --> Deep Neural Networks
            --> Convolutional Neural Networks
            --> Convolutional Neural Networks with Inception Module
            
    3. Evaluation:
            --> Model Accuracy
            --> Confusion Matrix
